Due to disruptions in the supply of materials and human resources, most projects in the provinces and cities affected by social distancing had to halt construction, and projects out of blocked areas were also delayed. The expense of maintaining the apparatus, the cost of epidemic prevention, and the cost of deploying resources after the lockdown are the most evident economic costs. Aside from the epidemic&#8217;s convoluted evolution, fluctuations in the price of raw materials have had a direct impact on construction investment prices, the efficiency of many projects, and the erosion of business profit margins.
