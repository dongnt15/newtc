										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>In order to ensure that each employee fully comprehends and performs their job functions effectively, Newtecons continuously organizes occupational safety training sessions throughout the system. This ensures that the project construction process is accurate in every detail and provides safety for workers right on the construction site.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Newtecons recently hosted a training session for more than 30 Vice Construction Site Managers and other elite employees on the theme &#8220;Safety management system,&#8221; with the energetic and enthusiastic presentation of Duong Hoang Giang, the head of the HSSE department.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The training class &#8220;Safety management system&#8221; of Newtecons&#8217; Vice Construction Site Manager training program 2022 &#8211; 2023 focused on general knowledge such as the safety management system&#8217;s vision, mission, and values; Operational structure of the occupational safety system; 4M + 1E occupational safety management system pillar; Foundational models of safety management systems; Vice Construction Site Manager’s roles and responsibilities; Formula 3-4-5-6 in safe system operation; and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The clear and insightful presentation of Mr. Duong Hoang Giang helps learners better understood the significance of safety work. Vice Construction Site Managers also gained the knowledge, courage, and self-control they needed to ensure the safety of workers and stakeholders, which contributed to the project&#8217;s overall success.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Mr. Nguyen Van Ba</strong>n shared after the course, “I&#8217;ve been to a lot of safety training sessions, but this one stands out for both its substance and its implementation. Boring safety knowledge is cleverly incorporated through games under the direction of Mr. Duong Hoang Giang, leaving a lasting memory”.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“After training, I realized the potential risks in the process of performing the work and measures to prevent these risks, as well as how to understand the organizational chart and how to coordinate with related departments to operate the job in the most efficient and safest way possible. I also sense the HSSE Department&#8217;s enthusiasm for developing the Occupational Safety Management system”, said <strong>Mr. Tran Duong Hong Quan</strong>.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Following an evaluation of their four months of training, Newtecons certified 17 engineers from the project and office in the M&amp;E Division in Shopdrawing and Revit. Mr. Vo Thanh Cang, representative of the Board of Directors and Director of the M&amp;E Division, presented certificates to learners who completed this course successfully.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the second Shopdrawing &amp; Revit course to be held this year. Students are trained in basic knowledge of design software such as Autocad, Naviswork, and Revit over the course of 15 lessons, with the goal of being able to apply it smoothly to building 3D models, check and publish construction drawings, combination drawings, and collision control, etc. after completing the course.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Mr. Thoi Van Hoi (Expert in Bidding Department – M&amp;E)</strong> took on the role of lecturer, ensuring that all knowledge was properly understood and effectively applied by learners. “To complete this course, students must have a tremendous amount of resolve and perseverance. When a large number of projects reach their peak, it can be difficult to focus on their studies. Nonetheless, they continued to study, attended all sessions in full, completed all assignments, and passed the final exam. I place a high value on learner effort”.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“As one of the Company&#8217;s new supervisors, I feel fortunate to have a good opportunity to attend the course and supplement my knowledge for the job, I had previously learned about Revit on my own, but it was sporadic. Since then, I have systematized my knowledge and applied it more effectively to my work, specifically for the bidding of a recent project”, said <strong>Mr. Le Minh Tam</strong> who received the highest honor for his graduation.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>During the VUCA period, when there were many fluctuations, complicated changes, that difficult to predict, and sometimes very vague, the market in general, and the real estate &#8211; construction market in particular, faced some certain challenges. These challenge require managers to shift their thinking toward flexibility, adaptability, and innovation.<em> “Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything”</em>, said George Bernard, and <em>“The measure of intelligence is the ability to change”</em>, said Einstein</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; background: white;"><strong><span style="color: #333333;">So, what is “flexible thinking”?</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Thinking with flexibility, sometimes referred to as COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY and MENTAL FLEXIBILITY, enables you to comprehend and accept the actions, thought processes, routines, way of life, and decisions of others.</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11991" src="https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3-2-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3-2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p><strong>Leaders in the VUCA era must have Vision &#8211; Knowledge &#8211; Courage &#8211; Adaptability to develop flexible thinking in operating and managing organizations. One of the most important abilities is the ability to think creatively. The Agile Thinking method follows rules but has no restrictions on how it is implemented as long as specific results are achieved.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p><b><i>“</i></b><b><i>Be clear about your goal but be flexible about the process of achieving it”</i></b><b><i>. </i></b><b>Brian Tracy</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Vo Thanh Liem also discussed with Newtecons employees how to cultivate flexible thinking skills such as KEEPING CALM, CONTROLLING TIME, SHARING PROBLEMS, and, most importantly, STARTING POSITIVE ATTITUDE. Managers should try to face change; stay calm when things don&#8217;t go as planned and give everyone the opportunity to come up with their own way of doing things. Look for external sensations; View from the expert&#8217;s point of view; Accept mixed feedback; Drop your ego.</p>

<p><strong>Many viewpoints were shared during the training session on the above-mentioned great topic, and many contributions were analyzed collectively.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p><em><strong>“It is challenging to be flexible in the process because of the nature of the construction sector, which is characterized by urgent progress and high-quality criteria”</strong></em>, said Mr. Phan Nhat Binh, Project Director.<em><strong> “So, in order to maximize productivity, we prioritize compliance and do our best to be adaptable in our work practices.”  </strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>According to the seminar analysis, Mr. Tran Thanh Hai &#8211; Project Director honestly admitted that he was not very flexible in managing and operating work. Mr. Hai told himself that he would change himself to become more flexible and run the organization in a more rhythmic manner as a result of this.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nhận được nhiều phản hồi tích cực và sự tham gia thảo luận nhiệt tình từ các thành viên tham dự, buổi seminar đã thành công hơn mong đợi. Tin rằng, mỗi CBQL sẽ kiên trì thực hành các phương pháp để rèn luyện tư duy linh hoạt, áp dụng vào trong quản lý và lan tỏa đến từng thành viên trong tổ chức. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Nearly 80 members of the NewStar Leaders Club from the North and Central regions gathered on August 19, 2022, in Hanoi to take part in the team-building activity that Newtecons had planned.</strong></p>
<p>Following the program&#8217;s success in Ho Chi Minh City, it continued to be held for talented members (team leaders, potential specialists) in the North and Central areas in Hanoi. More specifically NewStar club members (Deputy Construction Site Managers or Deputy Head Of Department and above) and higher levels from both regions participated in the program and exchanged knowledge.</p>

<blockquote><p>The General Director, Mr. Vo Thanh Liem, shared: &#8220;The series of team-building activities in both the South and the North have the same message: &#8220;be all you can be.&#8221; I want all Newtecons&#8217; people from the North, Central, and South to overcome their geographical differences, share the same goal, and put equal effort into building a powerful Newtecons. At the same time, we will be the &#8220;warriors&#8221; who are passionate about our work, excited about the games, keep a cold head and a hot heart that is filled with love and duty for the organization.</p></blockquote>

<p>The participants were split up into 5 teams, each representing one of Newtecons&#8217; 5 core values: Integrity, Unity, Kindness, Optimization, and Creativity. The team names serve as the &#8220;key&#8221; to completing the program&#8217;s tasks and also serve to exemplify the values and spirit of Newtecons: Integrity in all of one&#8217;s thoughts and deeds; unity among team members for a common goal; kindness toward one&#8217;s coworkers, employer, customers, and business partners; kindness toward one&#8217;s family and society; kindness toward oneself; constant proactive improvement; solutions to operate the work effectively; constant creation, updating, and innovation.</p>
<p>The teams had an impressive “opening” dance to warm up the team building.</p>

<p>All participants enjoy the laughter and moments of relaxation that movement games in team building provide. Participants can use this chance to show their skills, sense of humor, and ability to take on difficulties. Above all, the teamwork attitude is encouraged, and obstacles must be faced as a unit.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">With one goal, one direction, and one consensus to move forward, the series of team-building exercises in the two regions of the South and the North have successfully come to a conclusion. This has eliminated geographic-related barriers and distances. Along with the delight and memories, the message &#8220;Be all you can be&#8221; &#8211; to work hard, play hard, and be ready to adapt to any changes &#8211; remains ingrained in each member&#8217;s consciousness.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Nearly 120 members of the South&#8217;s Talent team attended a team-building activity that Newtecons organized on August 13, 2022, in the Van Thanh Tourist Village. This program is held the first time for the NewStar Leaders Club members.</strong></p>
<p>NewStar Leaders Club consists of 2 groups: the Star group for Deputy Heads of departments, Deputy Construction site managers, and higher levels, and the Talent group for Heads of departments and Potential Specialists. This is the first time the team building program has been expanded and organized for the Talent group with the aim of creating favorable conditions for all NewStar members to have the opportunity to exchange knowledge, learn new things and connect with each other.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Be all you can be&#8221; team building encourages Newtecons employees to work hard, play hard, and be ready to adapt to any changes to building resilience and substantial internal resources for the organization&#8217;s next move.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">&#8220;NewStar Club consistently prioritizes seeking for members with great knowledge and full leadership skills to join,&#8221; said Mr. Vo Thanh Liem, the General Director, during the program. I hope NewStar club, especially the Talent group, continued growth and success in the years to come. At the same time, through these team building programs, Newtecons&#8217; people have moments of fun, relaxation and more cohesion, consensus and enthusiasm at work.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The participants were split up into 5 teams, each representing one of Newtecons&#8217; 5 core values: Integrity, Unity, Kindness, Optimization, and Creativity. Through many physical games, the members are like enthusiastic &#8220;warriors&#8221;, burning with all their hearts, with the whole alliance team, using collective strength to overcome challenges.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Newtecons has consistently won bids and begun many projects in the first five months of the year, including Flora Panorama; Sora Garden SC; Hoa Phat Dung Quat 2; Service, Trade and Housing Center Project, Hamlet 4, Ward 1, Sa Dec City, and others, all of which are contributing to the company&#8217;s goal of revenue and profit growth beginning in 2022. Newtecons believes that the most essential goal is to consolidate the complete machine and raise the staff’s knowledge, bringing projects to a successful conclusion with the assurance of a powerful and elite team. As a result, Newtecons is constantly investing in training and upgrading the quality of its human resources.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Internal training activities at construction sites</strong></span> are remarkable in Newtecons&#8217; training operations from the beginning of the year till now. The Site Management Team has arranged these activities. Weekly training sessions are held, with tasks, substance, and themes separated according to the construction progress. The Site Management Team gathered the training content from a variety of sources, including the Technical Department, Human Resources &amp; Training Department, HSSE Department, Equipment Department, and others, as well as on-the-job construction methods and techniques, and the previous project implementation experience.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Site Management Team of the Phuoc Tho project was recently granted the <strong>“Excellent Site in Training”</strong> by the Newtecons Human Resources &amp; Training Department, as one of the typical construction sites in training activities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“With the growing expansion of Newtecons, in order to meet the workload, the Company in general, and the Phuoc Tho project in particular, the number of new recruits and young staff are quite large,&#8221;</em> <strong>Mr. Pham Huu Nghia, Construction Site Manager</strong>, said of the project’s training program. <em>“As a result, I believe that training is no longer solely the responsibility of the company, but also the responsibility of Site Management Team, who must work together to develop the Newtecons&#8217; people in order to train the next generation and ensure the integrity of the workforce.”</em> He also expressed his sincere thanks to the Board of Directors and Human Resources &amp; Training Department for their constant attention to the Site Management Team. This honor motivates Site Management Team of Phuoc Tho project to work harder and promote the training spirit to all Site Management Teams from other construction sites.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Site Management Team of the Hoa Phat Dung Quat project, which has been prominent with training work in the Central area in recent years, is also highly regarded by Newtecons Human Resources &amp; Training Department.<em> “The internal training program in Hoa Phat is held at 7pm every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,”</em> said <strong>Mr. Vo Dinh Thuan, Vice Construction Site Manager</strong> as one of the people directly involved in the training. <em>“We had 4 topics are Presenting the operation plan from the management level; Detailed work analysis from specialized teams; Process training (ordering, field management, bills, and records, etc.); Professional training (supervising steel, formwork, concrete, underground construction, etc.) The training program enabled the new supervisors gain information before starting work at the construction sites, and the Site Management Team machinery runs more smoothly and efficiently as a result of the agreed-upon plans.&#8221;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the Technical Department, the Communications Department, the Legal &amp; Policy Department and other functional departments also regularly train at each construction site to help the members of the Site Management Team understand the necessary knowledge for their work.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>In construction, technique is the key to transforming a design on paper into a finished product, and it is related with the project from start to finish. As a result, the Technical Department organized direct training sessions at each project to guide the Site Management Team measures for each specific stage prior to construction; at the same time, the Technical Department clearly identified common errors and offered appropriate plans, assisting in the reduction of potential risks<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>To improve individuals&#8217; roles in internal communication and communication activities, the Communications Department visited each site to help them understand the vision, mission, core values, culture, as well as the importance of communication and communication tools commonly used.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">The <strong>&#8220;Leadership Skills 5R&#8221;</strong> program for managers was recently organized by Newtecons Human Resources &amp; Training Department. This is a program in Newstar Club&#8217;s series of potential leadership development programs.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">Leadership is a very vital skill for a management position, especially for young managers who have little experience in a new role. The training program has provided a comprehensive picture of a long-term manager, clearly articulating the manager&#8217;s functions and responsibilities, as well as the competencies needed to become a true manager.</span></p>
<p>Speaker Phan Huu Loc (VMP Academy), who has more than 18 years of rigorous experience in management, leadership, and training, presented and communicated the lecture&#8217;s contents directly through graphics. Teaching formula 3V with Fun, Movement and Application provides a dynamic learning environment with instructions that are simple to understand and implement.</p>

<p><strong>Rights, Relationship, Result, Reproduction, and Respect</strong> are the <strong>5Rs</strong> in the training program, which correlate to the 5 ladders that the manager affects people for a common purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10703 aligncenter" src="https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_7058_fix.png" alt="" width="4843" height="3339" srcset="https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_7058_fix.png 4843w, https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_7058_fix-300x207.png 300w, https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_7058_fix-1024x706.png 1024w, https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_7058_fix-768x529.png 768w, https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_7058_fix-1536x1059.png 1536w, https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_7058_fix-2048x1412.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 4843px) 100vw, 4843px" /></p>
<p>Newtecons Human Resources &amp; Training Department believes that managers will learn and implement the following abilities as a result of the program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the five levels of leadership and know your own capacity;</li>
<li>Learn the way to communicate with coworkers and subordinates;</li>
<li>Learn the way to influence and motivate others;</li>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; background: white;"><span style="color: #073763;">Due to the detrimental impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the construction industry had a terrible year in 2021. Due to disruptions in the supply of materials and human resources, most projects in the provinces and cities affected by social distancing had to halt construction, and projects out of blocked areas were also delayed. The expense of maintaining the apparatus, the cost of epidemic prevention, and the cost of deploying resources after the lockdown are the most evident economic costs. Aside from the epidemic&#8217;s convoluted evolution, fluctuations in the price of raw materials have had a direct impact on construction investment prices, the efficiency of many projects, and the erosion of business profit margins. Newtecons has opted to grow internal resources and maintain its reputation with customers, partners, and employees, while other businesses are searching for methods to boost profits, cut personnel, reduce pay, and increase works.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>[March 30, 2022, Ho Chi Minh City] The Newtecons Construction Force</em></strong><strong><em> (CF)</em></strong><strong><em> Conference</em></strong> <strong><em>2022 was a success, with over 100 close partners who are subcontractors attending in person at Newtecons Tower headquarters and online.</em></strong></p>
<p>Subcontractors make a significant contribution to the success of each project. As a result, Newtecons holds a meeting and dialogue program once a year to listen to the sharing, difficulties, and obstacles in the cooperation process between subcontractors and the steering committee of construction sites to quickly eliminate such difficulties. The meetings annually help subcontractors feel secure about the lives of workers, and stabilize human resources, allowing the project to run more smoothly, with many initiatives to make the work more and more developed. This benefits not only subcontractors, but also the steering committee of building sites, assisting Newtecons in their development.</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Tran Kim Long &#8211; General Director of Newtecons shared an overview of the development process of Newtecons in the past time, the current situation as well as the company&#8217;s orientations in the coming time with the subcontractors. <strong><em>“I would like to express my gratitude for the companionship and joint role of </em></strong><strong><em>s</em></strong><strong><em>ubcontractors who have made important contributions to the success of Newtecons. Despite spending two years mobilizing workers during and after the epidemic, subcontractors have always shared the same passion and suffering as Newtecons to get through the difficult period and develop as it is today. In 2022, Newtecons achieves a revenue breakthrough, increasing from over 5,000 billion to more than 10,000 billion, which is a significant growth. In order to do so, Newtecons requires the companionship and support of partners, subcontractors, and suppliers, in addition to consolidating internal resources. I hope that the relationship between Newtecons and its </em></strong><strong><em>s</em></strong><strong><em>ubcontractors will be strengthened, committed, reputable, fair, and reciprocal in order to increase the parties&#8217; efficiency.&#8221;</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Thang further said that the cooperation strategy with subcontractors in 2022 has new policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>For strategic partners who are committed to the company, advance guarantee and warranty exemptions are waived.</li>
<li>Depending on the size and characteristics of the project, increase the percent of project advance payment for subcontractors.</li>
<li>Increase payment value in installments for strategic partners who have demonstrated a commitment to the company (in comparison to present regulations).</li>
<li>Contracting orientation includes labor, equipment, and materials.</li>
<li>Assisting subcontractors in obtaining financial support products from banks that are Newtecons partners, allowing subcontractors to manage cash flow and the lives of technicians and workers.</li>
<li>Ascertain the source of work so that subcontractors can feel comfortable that the apparatus will be maintained.</li>
<li>Raising the level by training subcontractor&#8217;s technical apparatus.</li>
</ul>
<p>The subcontractors openly communicated and contributed in detail to the outstanding challenges in the coordination process with the goal of understanding and continuing to passionately believe in Newtecons, assisting in the achievement of new successes.</p>

<p>Newtecons&#8217; Board of Directors and functional units responded quickly to each issue, provided a clear solution, and established favorable conditions for subcontractors. Newtecons has arranged full-time personnel and cross-checked projects; announced the reference price, which is updated annually in accordance with market conditions and project characteristics. Newtecons builts a flexible payment mechanism for strategic subcontractors; always use new equipment, comply with regulations, inspect, and tighten the delivery of equipment at the construction site to ensure the appropriate use of the equipment and increase labor productivity. That helps to restrict groups of &#8220;opportunity seekers&#8221; from exploiting obstacles to manipulate prices and obstruct labor mobilization for genuine subcontractors, ensuring fairness for all subcontractors in all operations.</p>

<p>The Newtecons representative also reminded the subcontractors to follow the Newtecons Board of Directors&#8217; occupational safety regulations, as this is the benchmark for ensuring the general safety of construction employees. Companionship, commitment, financial stability, always having a representative on duty, and cooperation with the project, as well as in agreement with the site management committee, for incident acceptance and timely handling are all conditions for becoming a subcontractor with the finest incentives. The Newtecons representative urged subcontractors to concentrate their efforts and &#8220;work hard&#8221; while working on projects with tight implementation timelines.</p>
<p>The CF Department should have more open rules to support subcontractors, according to the Newtecons Board of Directors, and the site management committee should have a fair progress point to help subcontractors mobilize personnel at the proper moment, be proactive in finance, and avoid losses. Other issues are also documented and addressed. The subcontractors may be entirely confident in their ability to establish the management apparatus and mobilize workers to stay with Newtecons in the future.</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Nguyen Dinh Thieu said in the contest, “<strong>I feel lucky and proud to get the prize. I have only been with Newtecons for a year, however, my company always makes it possible for me to attempt new things and gain experience in the field of BIM. This award is both a spiritual gift that pushes me to work harder and a recognition from my company that will help me be more determined to achieve the goals set for me. The new point while implementing BIM at the Flora Mizuki MP6-7-8 project is to use QR Code to examine and extract information from BIM LOD400, therefore this iPad reward will let me operate BIM application faster and easier.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>BIM</strong> (Building Information Modeling) is an advanced process applied in the construction industry (AEC) based on digital 3D models. BIM models are more advanced than simple 2D and 3D drawings, they are made up of accompanying intelligent models, which are changed and updated throughout the project development process.</p>
<p>Throughout the life cycle of building projects, BIM helps to optimize workflow by boosting design and operational efficiency. Individuals and organizations involved in the design and construction of works can utilize the data in the BIM model to analyze costs, timelines, and construction methods, as well as maintain the project.</p>
<p>Construction will become faster, more accurate, and less expensive as a result of the use of BIM in M&amp;E construction. As a result, BIM is quickly becoming a new trend and practically a required standard in the construction sector over the world.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of BIM application in project:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Centralize data management.</li>
<li>Easy to detect conflicts with intuitive model design, optimal design of details in the space of the building.</li>
<li>Save costs &#8211; time, reduce costs incurred and work time with consistent data management, avoid loss in the process of archiving and managing documents.</li>
<li>Boost collaboration: BIM connects departments closer, architectural design, structure, MEP, estimation departments, etc., All work on a unified model with all information updated on a regular basis to create a continuous flow of information.</li>
<li>Reduce risks: 3D models in BIM put all of the pieces of a real structure together to make it easier to spot conflicts between components, limit issues that arise during construction, reduce risk and minimize errors.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>REVIT</strong> is a software program designed to aid in the implementation of a construction project using the BIM process. Revit is viewed as a tool for making the BIM process more efficient.</p>
<p>Architects, Engineers, and BIM Specialists may ensure a simplified building process, enhance profit margins and save time by using Revit to create accurate 3D models. Furthermore, the Revit model&#8217;s benefits do not end after the building is completed; the BIM model can be updated to reflect current circumstances and then used for facility management or restoring historic structures.</p>

The Board of Directors and all levels of management were present for the signing ceremony.</strong></p>
<p>Newtecons has overcome a series of challenges caused by the pandemic, a lack of materials, equipment, and workers, and now has a revenue of 5,363 billion in 2021, making it one of the few leading construction enterprises with strong revenue growth compared to 2020. In the face of a tumultuous market, this is a tremendous effort by a cohesive team, from the Board of Directors to the company&#8217;s employees.</p>
<p>On January 21, at the ceremony of the 2022 production and business plan, the Newtecons Executive Board and the Heads of Departments/Divisions/Units sat down to discuss, present in detail and thoroughly the upcoming business plan. Each goal has gotten a lot of feedback, and comment, as well as the finest implementation solutions.</p>

<p>The employees from departments/construction sites also enthusiastically participated in the Communication Department&#8217;s contest &#8220;XMAS – XFUN: Double the Joy of Christmas&#8221; with sparkling photos and sweet and funny comments.

<p>The employees themselves plan and participate in these activities. This is the &#8220;glue&#8221; that sticks Newtecons people together across the country, from workplaces to construction sites.</p>
<p>When winter arrives, the most meaningful thing is neither a warm coat because the weather in some locations is still warm, nor the gleaming appearance because we cannot always afford glamorous Christmas decorations. The most important thing is the moment we are together, and Love, having no geography, knows no boundaries.</p>
<p>Wish all Newtecons employees a calm, joyful, and healthy holiday season to enter the New Year in 2022.</p>

<p><em>HR Asia’s survey result revealed vigorous efforts and unyielding spirit of all employees toward  common goals. Most of interviewees chose answers such as “We are willing to support our colleagues when they need our help”, “I will strive harder to achieve common goals of the company”; “I am constantly looking for ways to improve my performance and contribute to this organization.”</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This was highlighted by a seminar held during the ceremony to introduce to faculty and students “The Importance of BIM and its application in Newtecons Projects” and the implementation of emerging technologies in construction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the success of the Staff Meeting, the 2019 Year-End Party with the theme of “Newtecons Endless Innovation &#8211; Super Speed 2020” has made hundreds of employees burst into emotions by inspirational speeches, unique performances and reunited moments after a year of work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-15566 aligncenter" src="https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-BACKGROUND-scaled-1.jpg" alt="" width="609" height="401" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike programs of previous years, the ideas and the size of the guests of this year-end party are more in-depth and varied. In addition to the attendance of nearly 450 employees of the Company, the party welcomed the representatives of Coteccons Group’s Board of Directors and nearly 200 guests who are partners and customers of Newtecons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to have 90 minutes of sublimation on stage at Vinpearl Luxury Landmark 81, the Organization Board of the program in collaboration with Agency LongKan took nearly 2 months to develop ideas together, make reasonable plans based on the Board of Directors’ initial orientation of “Endless Innovation”. Additionally, the choice of venue is also an important step to create a feeling for the program. Landmark 81 is one of the major projects built by the hands and minds of Newtecons’ people. The image of the super speed train is used to show the speed of development &#8211; modernization – strength &#8211; connection with directions of Newtecons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-15567 aligncenter" src="https://newtecons.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ZU7A9599-scaled-1.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="421" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite a few shortcomings in the organization, for Newtecons’ people in particular and the guests attending, we had a night of uplifting and burning party. When the song “The Great Circle of Vietnam (Nối Vòng Tay Lớn)” was sung by Microwave Band, it was time for all people to connect shoulder to shoulder like small wagons to harmonize meaningful lyrics together. It is remarkable for this Year-End Party of Newtecons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Journey 2020 is coming so close, and Newtecons’ people are continuing to accelerate, make best effort and stand side-by-side together on next journeys.</p>
